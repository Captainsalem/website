## Applications Domain Not Working?

You see the deployment succeeded, and logs are running, but the domain isn't working? Here's what to check:

1. **Correct Port Mapping**: Ensure the domain is using the correct port for your application. For example, if you're using Next.js, the port should be `3000`, or for Laravel, it should be `8000`. If you change the app port, update the domain to reflect that.
2. **Avoid Using `Ports` in Advanced Settings**: Generally, there's no need to use the `Ports` feature unless you want to access your app via `IP:port`. Leaving this feature enabled may interfere with your domain.

3. **Let's Encrypt Certificates**: It's crucial to point the domain to your server's IP **before** adding it in Dokploy. If the domain is added first, the certificate won't be generated, and you may need to recreate the domain or restart Traefik.

4. **Listen on 0.0.0.0, Not 127.0.0.1**: If your app is bound to `127.0.0.1` (which is common in Vite apps), switch it to `0.0.0.0` to allow external access.

## Logs and Monitoring Not Working After Changing Application Placement?

This is expected behavior. If the application is running on a different node (worker), the UI won't have access to logs or monitoring, as they're not on the same node.

## Mounts Are Causing My Application Not to Run?

Docker Swarm won't run your application if there are invalid mounts, even if the deployment shows as successful. Double-check your mounts to ensure they are valid or check the General Swarm Section
and find your application, and you will see the real error.

## Volumes in Docker Compose Not Working?

For Docker Compose, all file mounts defined in the `volumes` section will be stored in the `files` folder. This is the default directory structure:

## I added a volume to my docker compose, but is not finding the volume?

For docker compose all the file mounts you've created in the volumes section will be stored to files folder, this is the default structure of the docker compose.

```
/application-name
    /code
    /files
```

So instead of using this invalid way to mount a volume:

```yaml
volumes:
    - "/folder:/path/in/container" ❌
```

You should use this format:

```yaml
volumes:
    - "../files/my-database:/var/lib/mysql" ✅
    - "../files/my-configs:/etc/my-app/config" ✅
```

## Logs Not Loading When Deploying to a Remote Server?

There are a few potential reasons for this:

1. **Slow Server:**: If the server is too slow, it may struggle to handle concurrent requests, leading to SSL handshake errors.
2. **Insufficient Disk Space:** If the server doesn't have enough disk space, the logs may not load.

## Docker Compose Domain Not Working?

When adding a domain in your Docker Compose file, it's not necessary to expose the ports directly. Simply specify the port where your app is running. Exposing the ports can lead to conflicts with other applications or ports.

Example of what not to do:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: dokploy/dokploy:latest
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```

Recommended approach:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: dokploy/dokploy:latest
    ports:
      - 3000
      - 80
```

This is only valid for Docker Compose not for Docker Stack.

When using Docker Stack, the ports are exposed automatically, so you don't need to specify them explicitly.

Example of what not to do:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: dokploy/dokploy:latest
    ports:
      - 3000
```

Recommended approach:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: dokploy/dokploy:latest
    expose:
      - 3000
```

Then, when creating the domain in Dokploy, specify the service name and port, like this:

```yaml
domain: my-app.com
serviceName: app
port: 3000
```

- Another reason of the domains are not working it may be because the healthchecks you've defined are not working, so this will cause the domains never work, so you have two options:

1. Remove the healthcheck from the service
2. Make sure the healthcheck is working

## Getting "Bad Gateway Error" When Accessing Your Application Domain

If you're encountering a Bad Gateway Error when accessing your application through its domain, this typically indicates one of several common configuration issues:

### Common Causes
1. **Port Mismatch**: The configured port might be incorrect
2. **Listen Address Configuration**: The service might be listening only on `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`

### Common Solution for Modern JavaScript Frameworks
This issue frequently occurs with modern JavaScript frameworks like Vite, Astro, or Vue.js applications. By default, these frameworks often listen only on localhost (`127.0.0.1`).

To resolve this, you need to configure your application to listen on all available network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).

#### Example Configuration for Vite
Here's how to properly configure a Vite application:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [react()],
	preview: {
		port: 3000,
		host: true,    // This enables listening on all network interfaces
	},
	server: {        // Also add this for development server
		host: true,    // This enables listening on all network interfaces
		port: 3000
	}
});
```

### Framework-Specific Notes
- **Vite Apps**: Use the configuration above
- **Astro**: Similar configuration in `astro.config.mjs`
- **Vue.js**: Configure in `vite.config.js` if using Vite
- **Other Frameworks**: Check your framework's documentation for network interface configuration

Remember to deploy again your application after making these changes for them to take effect.

## Docker Compose Volume Mounts

When using Docker Compose, you can configure volume mounts in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
volumes:
  - my-database:/var/lib/mysql
```

### Use of closed network when restarting Traefik

If you see this error in the logs of Traefik, it means that the network is being closed, this is the normal behavior when restarting Traefik.

```bash
05/23/25, 12:21:12 PM info 2025-05-23T09:21:12Z ERR: error="accept tcp [::]:443: use of closed network connection" entryPointName=websecure
05/23/25, 12:21:12 PM info 2025-05-23T09:21:12Z ERR: error="accept tcp [::]:9000: use of closed network connection" entryPointName=traefik
05/23/25, 12:21:12 PM info 2025-05-23T09:21:12Z ERR: error="accept tcp [::]:80: use of closed network connection" entryPointName=web
05/23/25, 12:21:12 PM info 2025-05-23T09:21:12Z ERR: error="close tcp [::]:9000: use of closed network connection" entryPointName=traefik
05/23/25, 12:21:12 PM info 2025-05-23T09:21:12Z ERR: error="close tcp [::]:443: use of closed network connection" entryPointName=websecure
05/23/25, 12:21:12 PM info 2025-05-23T09:21:12Z ERR: error="close tcp [::]:80: use of closed network connection" entryPointName=web
```

### Creating Configuration Files

If you need to create configuration files before deploying your compose setup:

1. Go to Advanced -> Mounts
2. Create a new File Mount
3. Add your configuration content in the content field
4. Specify the file path for your configuration

Note: All File Mounts are automatically created in the `/files` directory. For example, if you create a file named `my-config.json`, it will be available at `/files/my-config.json`.

You can then reference this configuration file in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ../files/my-config.json:/etc/my-app/config
```


## Failed to initialize Docker Swarm

Error response from daemon: must specify a listening address because the address to advertise is not recognized as a system address, and a system's IP address to use could not be uniquely identified

This error occurs when the Docker Swarm is not properly initialized.

To fix this, you need to assign a the public IP address to the Docker Swarm, ideally you can use a private IP address from your network, but if you require features from docker swarm, you
will need to use a public IP address.

```bash
curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | ADVERTISE_ADDR=your-ip sh
```


## My Dokploy UI Instance is Not Accessible

If you can't access your Dokploy UI instance, there could be several causes. While this issue won't occur with Dokploy Cloud (where our team manages the infrastructure), self-hosted instances might encounter configuration problems.

Let's go through the possible cases where your Dokploy UI instance might be inaccessible:

### 1. Insufficient Storage Space

If you've made many deployments and don't have available space on your server, the Dokploy database might enter recovery mode, preventing access to the user interface. Here's a quick solution to clear cache and free up server space:

```bash
docker system prune -a
docker builder prune -a
docker image prune -a
```

### 2. Container Race Condition During Restart

During a restart, a race condition might occur where Dokploy's dependent containers don't start in the correct order. To troubleshoot this:

First, verify the running containers:
```bash
docker ps
```

You should see all four of these containers running:
```bash
2a5b955c32b6   dokploy/dokploy:latest      "docker-entrypoint.s…"   4 days ago     Up 4 days     0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp, :::3000->3000/tcp                                                                             dokploy.1.4bkuszk98muz372kw5mvwkw0h
5a989bf52bc6   postgres:16                 "docker-entrypoint.s…"   4 days ago     Up 4 days     5432/tcp                                                                                                              dokploy-postgres.1.9hvjaxrmby7ex2denjtwo0csf

05be01c5612f   traefik:v2.5                "/entrypoint.sh trae…"   4 days ago     Up 4 days     0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, :::80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, :::443->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, :::8080->8080/tcp   dokploy-traefik.1.2oktabjmfu558x2d2dy6czt8m
```

If all four containers are running but you still can't access the interface, it's time to debug:

### Debugging Process

#### 1. Check Container Logs
Start by examining the logs of each container:

```bash
docker service logs dokploy # Dokploy UI
docker service logs dokploy-postgres # Postgres
docker service logs dokploy-redis # Redis
docker logs dokploy-traefik # Traefik
```

#### 2. Common Database Connection Issue

A common case is when the Postgres container starts after the Dokploy container, preventing Dokploy from connecting to the database. You might see logs like this when running `docker service logs dokploy`:

```ts
> dokploy@v0.22.3 start /app
> node -r dotenv/config dist/server.mjs

Default middlewares already exists
Network is already initilized
Main config already exists
Default traefik config already exists
Migration failed [Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND dokploy-postgres] {
  errno: -3008,
  code: 'ENOTFOUND',
  syscall: 'getaddrinfo',
  hostname: 'dokploy-postgres'
}
Setting up cron jobs....
Main Server Error [Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND dokploy-postgres] {
  errno: -3008,
  code: 'ENOTFOUND',
  syscall: 'getaddrinfo',
  hostname: 'dokploy-postgres'
}
```

To fix this, restart the Dokploy service:
```bash
docker service scale dokploy=0
# Then
docker service scale dokploy=1
```

#### 3. Traefik Configuration Issues

If all containers are running but you still can't access the UI, and Dokploy logs show no errors, the Traefik container might have configuration issues.

When running `docker logs dokploy-traefik`, you might see errors like:

```shell
2025-04-07T15:20:18Z ERR Error occurred during watcher callback error="/etc/dokploy/traefik/dynamic/dokploy.yml: field not found, node: passHostHeader" providerName=file
```

First, try restarting Traefik:
```bash
docker restart dokploy-traefik
```

If you still can't access it and the same error persists in the Traefik logs, you'll need to check the Traefik configuration. In this case, the error indicates that the `passHostHeader` field is missing in the configuration.

If you've modified any Traefik configuration for an `application` and added invalid configuration, the logs will point to the error. For example, the error above mentions `field not found, node: passHostHeader`, which means we need to manually modify the configuration files in `/etc/dokploy/traefik`.

Here's an example of an invalid configuration:

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    dokploy-router-app:
      rule: Host(`my-domain.com`)
      service: dokploy-service-app
      entryPoints:
        - web
      middlewares:
        - redirect-to-https
    dokploy-router-app-secure:
      rule: Host(`my-domain.com`)
      service: dokploy-service-app
      entryPoints:
        - websecure
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
  services:
    dokploy-service-app:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://dokploy:3000
          - passHostHeader: true
```

The correct configuration should be:

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    dokploy-router-app:
      rule: Host(`my-domain.com`)
      service: dokploy-service-app
      entryPoints:
        - web
      middlewares:
        - redirect-to-https
    dokploy-router-app-secure:
      rule: Host(`my-domain.com`)
      service: dokploy-service-app
      entryPoints:
        - websecure
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
  services:
    dokploy-service-app:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://dokploy:3000
        passHostHeader: true
```

After fixing the configuration, restart Traefik:
```bash
docker restart dokploy-traefik
```

You should now be able to access the user interface.


## Recreate dokploy containers

In the case you want to recreate the dokploy services, you can do the following:


Remove the dokploy-redis service:
```bash
docker service rm dokploy-redis

# Create a new dokploy-redis service
  docker service create \
  --name dokploy-redis \
  --constraint 'node.role==manager' \
  --network dokploy-network \
  --mount type=volume,source=redis-data-volume,target=/data \
  redis:7
```

Remove the dokploy-postgres service:

```bash
docker service rm dokploy-postgres

# Create a new dokploy-postgres service
  docker service create \
  --name dokploy-postgres \
  --constraint 'node.role==manager' \
  --network dokploy-network \
  --env POSTGRES_USER=dokploy \
  --env POSTGRES_DB=dokploy \
  --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=amukds4wi9001583845717ad2 \
  --mount type=volume,source=dokploy-postgres-database,target=/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  postgres:16
```


Remove the dokploy-traefik service:

```bash
# If you are using docker standalone traefik
docker rm -f dokploy-traefik

docker run -d \
    --name dokploy-traefik \
    --restart always \
    -v /etc/dokploy/traefik/traefik.yml:/etc/traefik/traefik.yml \
    -v /etc/dokploy/traefik/dynamic:/etc/dokploy/traefik/dynamic \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -p 80:80/tcp \
    -p 443:443/tcp \
    -p 443:443/udp \
    traefik:v3.5.0

docker network connect dokploy-network dokploy-traefik

# If you are using docker service traefik
docker service rm dokploy-traefik

# Create a new dokploy-traefik service
docker run -d \
    --name dokploy-traefik \
    --restart always \
    -v /etc/dokploy/traefik/traefik.yml:/etc/traefik/traefik.yml \
    -v /etc/dokploy/traefik/dynamic:/etc/dokploy/traefik/dynamic \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -p 80:80/tcp \
    -p 443:443/tcp \
    -p 443:443/udp \
    traefik:v3.5.0
```

Remove the dokploy service:

```bash
docker service rm dokploy

# Create a new dokploy service

# We need the advertise address to be set which is the Private IP of your server, you can get it by running the following command:

# Run this command to get the private IP of your server:

# Copy this value and paste in the ADVERTISE_ADDR variable:
ip addr show | grep -E "inet (192\.168\.|10\.|172\.1[6-9]\.|172\.2[0-9]\.|172\.3[0-1]\.)" | head -n1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1

# Create the dokploy service
docker service create \
  --name dokploy \
  --replicas 1 \
  --network dokploy-network \
  --mount type=bind,source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock \
  --mount type=bind,source=/etc/dokploy,target=/etc/dokploy \
  --mount type=volume,source=dokploy-docker-config,target=/root/.docker \
  --publish published=3000,target=3000,mode=host \
  --update-parallelism 1 \
  --update-order stop-first \
  --constraint 'node.role == manager' \
  -e ADVERTISE_ADDR="Eg: 192.168.1.100" \
  dokploy/dokploy:latest
```



### Final Notes

While the specific issues may vary, the general troubleshooting approach remains similar to what we've described above, and is the general way we always follow when correcting a problem related to the dokploy instance not starting.. If you still can't access the user interface:
1. Check that all containers are running properly
2. Review the logs of each container for specific error messages
3. Verify all configuration files
4. Make sure to read the Traefik documentation for detailed configuration options: https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/
