## Overview

Environment variables in Dokploy allow you to:
- Define configuration once and reuse it
- Share values across multiple services
- Reference values from within the same service
- Centrally manage sensitive information

## Defining Variables

You can declare environment variables either:
- **Project-level (shared)** — available across all services in the project
- **Service-level** — specific to a single service

## Project-Level Variables

### Practical Example

Let's consider a common scenario where you have:
- A PostgreSQL database
- Two services that need to connect to this database

### 1. Define Shared Variable

In the project's shared variables section, define:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@database:5432/postgres
```

### 2. Use the Variable in Services

In each service's environment variables tab, reference the shared variable:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=${{project.DATABASE_URL}}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Dokploy will automatically replace `${{project.DATABASE_URL}}` with the value defined in the project's shared variables.
</Callout>

You can use shared environment variables in all the services available in dokploy.

## Service-Level Variables

Service-level variables are specific to a single service and can be used to override shared variables or define service-specific configurations.

### Practical Example

Let's say you have a service that requires a different database user. You can define a service-level variable:

```bash
DATABASE_USER=service_user
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${{DATABASE_USER}}:${{project.DATABASE_PASSWORD}}@service-database:5432/postgres
```

<Callout type="info">
  Preview Deployments environments also include a service-level variable called `DOKPLOY_DEPLOY_URL`, which points to the deployment URL of the service.
  It can be used as `${{DOKPLOY_DEPLOY_URL}}` for variables like `APP_URL=https://${{DOKPLOY_DEPLOY_URL}}`.
</Callout>

### Best Practices

- Use shared variables for credentials and configurations that repeat across services
- Keep descriptive variable names
- Document the purpose of each variable for easier maintenance
